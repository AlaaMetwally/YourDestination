This is the general idea :-
set marker “Icon” in “google map” for “banks” and “museum”  which about 
5 kilometers from you and set different “Icon”  one for “museum” and another 
for   “banks” and set “polylines” to each of them from your current location 
and send “notification” when you are about kilometer of any of the markers

How to start the project first if you are working in the simulator so you should set your custom location first 
Debug > location > custom location

second : there is a problem with my api key I am not using paid apis so many errors are appearing and I can't complete
my project because of this so I need a paid api key so I can complete my project if not so I think I will implement another project from scratch :)
